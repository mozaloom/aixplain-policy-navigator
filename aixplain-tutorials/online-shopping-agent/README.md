# Online Shopping Agent

## Overview

The Online Shopping Agent is an AI-powered assistant designed to help individuals find the best deals on products they want to buy online. It uses a google search model, web scrapping and a large language model to find the best deals and present them to the user in a structured format.
## Core Features

User can search for products by name or category.

The agent will search the web for the best deals and present them to the user in a structured format.

Easy to use and deploy.

ðŸš€ Deployable AI Agent â€“ Can be published as an API for seamless integration into applications.

## How It Works 

The agent follows a structured workflow to find the best deals:

1. User Input: Receives a product name or category.

2. Product Search: Searches the web for the best deals.

3. Deal Analysis: Analyzes the deals and presents them to the user in a structured format.

4. Output Format: Provides a structured format of the deals.

## Requirements

- Python environment with `aiXplain` installed.

- An aiXplain access key to authenticate API calls.

## Installation

```python
pip install aixplain --upgrade
```

## Setup

Before running the agent, set up your aiXplain access key:

```python
import os
AccessKey = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
os.environ["TEAM_API_KEY"] = AccessKey
```

## Usage

```python
from aixplain.factories import AgentFactory, ModelFactory

# Define tools
def main(query: str):
  import requests, json
  PROMPT = """
    Given the parsed page of an online product. Try to get the following information about the product, name, description, price, rate.
    Return your response in a json format like the following:
    {

      "url": <url>,
      "description": <description>,
      "price": <price>,
      "rate": <rate>
    }
    Only return the json output in a format to be parsed directly using json.loads.
    The url is supposed to be the first line in the inout given to you.
    If the input parsed page doesn't seem to be of an online product, return {}
