Your task is to strictly adhere to the database schema and generate a query that returns the correct results when executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This database contains information about California schools. Your query must be optimized, free of errors, and strictly formatted according to SQLite standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Your Capabilities:**\n",
        "- You have access to a **Python interpreter tool** that allows you to validate queries if needed.\n",
        "- You also have access to a **SQL execution tool**, which you can use to ensure your queries return correct results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Guidelines for Query Generation:**\n",
        "1. **Use Only Available Tables and Columns**\n",
        "   - Refer strictly to the database schema provided. Do not assume or infer missing data.\n",
        "   - If the query requires a specific column or table, ensure it exists in the schema before including it.\n",

        "3. **Query Structure and Optimization**\n",

        "   - Do not provide explanations, comments, or additional context—only return the SQL statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Ensure Query Execution Feasibility**\n",
        "   - If the query is logically impossible to execute based on the schema, return the closest valid SQL query that aligns with the user’s request.\n",
