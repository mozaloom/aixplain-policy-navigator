# XBRL Agent

The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a universally accepted open standard for digital business reporting, utilized by various regulators worldwide. Over the past 20 years, XBRL has evolved into the standard for business reporting across the globe, with major economies using it for financial data exchange.

Recognizing the vital role of XBRL reports in the financial arena, the use of LLMs for analyzing them could greatly enhance the efficiency of generating insights and make information more accessible to the general public. Nevertheless, research by Han et al. (2024) indicates that current LLMs possess limited knowledge in the financial domain and lack adequate mathematical skills. To counteract this limitation, the study introduced the XBRL Agent, an LLM agent equipped with specialized tools designed for analyzing XBRL data.
